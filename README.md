Project Overview
This project focuses on the in-depth analysis and forecasting of geospatial and temporal data related to Dolphin species within the Northern Indian Ocean. The primary objective is to gain insights into trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data, and to model these dynamics for future forecasting. The project utilizes a wide array of statistical and machine learning techniques, combined with geospatial analysis, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.
Data Loading and Preprocessing
The project begins with loading data from an Excel file, followed by rigorous preprocessing. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring that the `Date` column is correctly formatted. The dataset is filtered to focus on the relevant time period (2012-2017), and additional temporal features such as month and year are extracted for further analysis. The preprocessing ensures the data is clean and ready for subsequent analyses.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory phase includes several key analyses. Temporal analysis is conducted to visualize trends in Dolphin Total Number (DTN) and Dolphin Total Weight (DTW) over the years. Correlation analysis explores the relationship between these variables, supported by scatter plots and statistical metrics. The project also features density mapping to visualize the geographical distribution of DTN and DTW, along with box plots and heatmaps to understand the distribution and correlation of variables across different months and geographical locations.
Advanced Analytical Techniques
The project delves into advanced data analysis and feature engineering techniques. Cluster analysis using KMeans identifies geographical clusters, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces data dimensionality, making complex relationships more interpretable. Interaction effects between variables are analyzed using linear regression, revealing how latitude and longitude interact to influence DTN and DTW.
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
Time series decomposition techniques, including STL and seasonal-trend decomposition, are employed to break down DTN and DTW into their trend, seasonal, and residual components. Anomaly detection identifies outliers in the time series data, and seasonal analysis using ANOVA tests highlights differences in DTN and DTW across seasons. The project also implements regression models, including Random Forest and ARIMA, for predicting future values of DTN and DTW. Additionally, more sophisticated forecasting methods like LSTM neural networks and Prophet are applied to model complex temporal patterns.
Spatial and Geospatial Analysis
Spatial analysis is a significant component of the project. Moran's I statistic is used to assess spatial autocorrelation in DTN and DTW, and spatial lag models are developed to understand spatial dependencies. Geospatial clustering using DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering further refines the understanding of how DTN and DTW are distributed across different regions. These analyses provide critical insights into the spatial dynamics of the species under study.
Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) and Advanced Modeling
The project utilizes Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models to capture and forecast trends and seasonality in the data. These models, implemented using TensorFlow Probability, offer a robust framework for understanding the underlying temporal dynamics. The project also features advanced model interpretation tools, including partial dependence plots and SHAP values, to explain the importance of different features in predictive models.
Anomaly and Change Point Detection
Anomalies in the data are detected using various methods, including Prophet and Z-score-based techniques. Change point detection, performed using the Binseg algorithm, identifies structural shifts in the time series data. These methods help in understanding significant changes in the dataset that might indicate environmental or operational shifts.
Logging and Debugging
Throughout the project, extensive logging is implemented to track the progress of each analytical step and to capture any errors that occur. This logging framework not only facilitates debugging but also ensures transparency and reproducibility in the analysis.

This project provides a comprehensive analytical framework for understanding and forecasting Dolphin-related data in the Northern Indian Ocean. By integrating advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and geospatial analysis, it offers valuable insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of marine species, with applications in conservation and fisheries management.
